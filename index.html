    <h2>Her upbringing</h2>
    <p>Harleen Kang Kaur was born on the 25th of october in the state of Uttar Pradesh in North India. She was the first child of her household and it remained the same up until 2009 where her little brother Anmol was born.
    She grew up being really close to her grandparents, sometimes acting more like her true parents. Her mother, Navneet Kang, was a teacher at an elementary school that she used to attend. Being the teachers daughter, Harleen had really good grades growing up and her parents had high expectation of her. This remained the same and followed through the next part of her life.</p>

  <div id="Immigration">
    <h2>Immigration</h2>
    <p>Harleen and her familly immigrated from india during 2019, they moved all 4 of them into this lost region of Niagra Falls (fr tho why there???). Having immigrated during grade 9, it means that she has to attend High School, which she attented A.N Myer High School. Located in Stamford, Niagara Falls, she would spend the next 3 years of her life there. Her immigration wasn't the easiest since she would leave behind her grandparents that she cherished and loved with all her heart. Things would get better while time progressed and made new friends.</p>

<div id="Her Friends">
  <h2> Her Friends</h2>
  <p>Coming to another country meant meeting new people and making new friends. This would be challenging for Harleen since she is someone more introverted, yet this didnt stop her. By Grade 10 she had a decent ammount of friendsv and felt like she had her place. She had met Gigi which would be her most important and closest friend during those times, they would spend a lot of time together and eventually became best friends. She would later get also close with Erika, Gigi's cousin that was a year older than her and to this day still talk to about problems. Harleen later on had her little "clique" that essentially consisted of Harleen, Gigi, Abu, Shin, Riddick, and those whose names shall not be named.

  <h2> Her Love Life</h2>
  <p> During the summer of 2022, due to the merge in friend group, she met me, Ryad, on the 24th of june 2022. Saying we didnt immediatly clicked would be an understatment, only a couple days after even speaking to each others we werent dming each others and were following each others on almost every plateform. We clicked so hard that people were starting to question if we loved each others or not, so you can see it was a matchmade in heavens. Shortly after, Harleen had to leave for india where she would be gone for 2 months, despite all of that, ryad kept texting her all day and carry on multiple conversation on multiple plateform. After spending so much time texting each other and talking, even going as far as barely sleeping to talk to each other, some feelings started developping for both parties(even tho i already had some yk). In the 14 of august, ryad admitted to liking her, but for some reason took almost two weeks to ask her to be his girlfriend(so dumb ikik). Ever since then we've been dating, closing in 15 months, through hardship, distance, emotions, problems, health issues, we've never stopped loving each others a single bit.</p>
